The myrater project is written to be deployed as a lambda service that is exposed via a Web Service
API endpoint.  

external_rater.py - This file takes care of converting the inputs to a format that can be easily
processed by an external pricing algorithm and packaging the return value in a format that
is defined in the Socotra External Rater feature 
(https://docs.socotra.com/production/tooling/external-rater.html).

myrater.py - This file implements the pricing logic for the personal-auto policy that ships with
the Socotra default configuration.  The algorithm is identical and yields identical results as
the liquid logic. In many cases, python or another procedural language makes it easy to manage
rating algorithms.
